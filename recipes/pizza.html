    <p>
        Pizza on the grill is a fantastic way to make pizza at home! The heat of a hot grill is a perfect match for a professional pizza oven. This grilled pizza recipe makes the dough from scratch and flavors it with garlic and basil. Use your favorite variety of toppings and shredded cheese, but it's best not to overload the pizza.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>Toppings of your choice (e.g., mozzarella, tomato sauce, pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, bell peppers)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine warm water and yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes until yeast is activated and foamy.</li>
        <li>Add olive oil, salt, and 2 cups of flour. Mix until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the remaining 2 cups of flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Lightly oil the grill grate.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough into a thin circle, about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to the grill, seam side down. Grill for about 2-3 minutes, or until the bottom is lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Add your favorite toppings and shredded cheese. Grill for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Remove from the grill and let cool slightly before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
